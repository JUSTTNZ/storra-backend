          "textContent": "In this lesson, pupils will learn to count from one up to twenty using common items found around them. Counting is the foundation of mathematics and helps pupils recognize the order and value of numbers. They will practice counting with fruits, toys, books, and classroom objects. Teachers are encouraged to make it interactive by letting pupils clap, jump, or tap for each number they say. As pupils count repeatedly, they begin to understand that each number represents a specific quantity. They also learn that numbers follow one another in a fixed order, which is important for later topics like addition and subtraction. This lesson builds confidence and helps them recognize written numbers as symbols that stand for quantities in real life.",

          "textContent": "Shapes are everywhere around us. In this lesson, pupils learn about basic shapes such as circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles. They will see how everyday objects like plates, books, doors, and roofs are examples of these shapes. A circle is round like a plate, a square has four equal sides like a windowpane, and a triangle has three sides like the roof of a house. Recognizing shapes helps pupils describe the world around them and builds their visual thinking. Teachers can make learning fun by drawing shapes on the board and asking pupils to find similar shapes in the classroom. With practice, children will be able to name and differentiate shapes quickly.",

For example, if you have two oranges and your friend gives you one more, you now have three oranges. In this lesson, pupils will learn how to add small numbers using real-life examples and pictures. Teachers can demonstrate with bottle tops or counting blocks. Pupils should say each step out loud as they add: 'Two plus one equals three'. This repetition helps them understand that addition increases a number's value. With continued practice, they will be able to perform simple additions mentally or by writing them down. Addition is the building block for all higher mathematical operations.",

In this lesson, pupils will explore subtraction using items they can see and touch. Teachers can use classroom materials such as pencils or books to show how quantities decrease when something is removed. Pupils will learn subtraction symbols and how to say subtraction sentences like 'five minus two equals three'. Understanding subtraction helps pupils in solving problems related to sharing, buying, and giving change in real-life situations. The lesson emphasizes practical examples to make learning meaningful.",

          "textContent": "This lesson teaches pupils how to compare two or more numbers to know which is larger, smaller, or equal. Comparing helps pupils understand order and quantity. For instance, when comparing 4 and 7, we can say 7 is greater than 4, while 4 is less than 7. Pupils will also learn to use the symbols >, <, and = correctly. Teachers can make this interesting by using items like pencils or fruits to represent numbers. As pupils practice, they begin to see patterns and relationships between numbers. This skill becomes important in later topics like number sequencing and problem solving.",

They will also learn how each letter sounds — for example, A says 'ah', B says 'buh', and C says 'kuh'. Understanding letter sounds helps pupils begin to read and spell words correctly.
